            <p class="talk">Secondly, student activities play an important role in our college life. To be honest, the student Union is a good place where one can develop social skills, get his abilities trained. I take part in many student activities. For example, I’
                m a volunteer, teaching the kids to learn to dance and write. I think it’s meaningful for everyone to give a hand to others. I can also do some jobs in the Student Union, including receiving and sending fast mail, selling papers and magazines.
                I think they’re unforgettable and worthwhile experiences for me.</p>

            <p class="talk">As we know, many people favor the idea that the college life is free and comfortable, but I’d like to say it’s not true. As a matter of fact, my life in university is so busy that I wonder if my energy is enough. As to my college life, I divide
                it into four parts, including study, student activities, library and the others.

            <p class="talk">One year ago,I was eager to be a university student. Because in my mind, university life is very relaxing. We will far away from home and borden our horison. Besides we will don't need to do so much homework. The moment the college entrance
                examination ended, I was so relaxed and pleased.</p>
